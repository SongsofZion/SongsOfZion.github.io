<summary>How to Use this Digital Songbook</summary>

<ul>
<li>This digital songbook is best viewed in a regular web browser.</li>
<li>Scroll down to the <a href="#songs-of-zion-index">Songs of Zion:
Index</a>, pinch to zoom if the font is displayed too small on your
device, click anywhere to the right of a triangle icon to view a list of
song numbers, and tap on a song number to view its lyrics.</li>
<li>You can collapse any expanded list of song numbers by tapping
anywhere to the right of its triangle icon</li>
<li>You can also use your browser's search functionality to jump
directly to a song. For example to view Song No.215, click
<strong>Find</strong> in your browser's menu and type
<strong>z215</strong> (the song number preceded by z)</li>
<li>From any song, you can quickly jump back to the index of songs by
clicking the <strong>Back to Index</strong> link displayed below the
song number.</li>
<li>Lastly, you can also use your browser's search functionality to
search for any phrase that you remember in a song. Typically, browsers
have case insensitive searches. So, for example, searching for either
"Amazing grace" or "amazing grace" should take you to Song No.215 ; and
searching for "how sweet" and then clicking Next in your search box,
should take you through all the songs containing the phrase "how
sweet."</li>

O my soul, praise Him, for He is thy health and salvation!<br />
All ye who hear,<br />
Brothers and sisters draw near,<br />
Praise Him in glad adoration.</p>
<p>2 Praise to the Lord, who doth prosper thy work and defend
thee;<br />
Surely His goodness and mercy here daily attend thee;<br />
Ponder anew<br />
What the Almighty can do,<br />
If with His love He befriend thee.</p>
<p>3 Praise to the Lord, who, when tempests their warfare are
waging,<br />
Who, when the elements madly around thee are raging,<br />
Biddeth them cease,<br />
Turneth their fury to peace,<br />
Whirlwinds and waters assuaging.</p>
<p>4 Praise to the Lord, who, when darkness and sin is abounding,<br />
Who, when the godless do triumph, all virtue confounding,<br />
Sheddeth His light,<br />
Chaseth the horrors of night,<br />
Saints with His mercy surrounding.</p>
<p>5 Praise to the Lord! O let all that is in me adore Him!<br />
All that hath life and breath, come now with praises before Him;<br />

Who reigns enthroned above,<br />
Ancient of everlasting days,<br />
And God of love<br />
Jehovah! great I AM!<br />
By earth and heaven confessed;<br />
I bow and bless the sacred Name<br />
For ever blessed.</p>
<p>2 The God of Abraham praise<br />
At whose supreme command<br />
From earth I rise, and seek the joys<br />
At his right hand.<br />
I all on earth forsake —<br />
Its wisdom, fame and power —<br />
And Him my only portion make,<br />
My Shield and Tower.</p>
<p>3 The goodly land we see,<br />
With peace and plenty blessed:<br />
A land of sacred liberty<br />
And endless rest;<br />
There milk and honey flow,<br />
And oil and wine abound,<br />
And trees of life for ever grow,<br />
With mercy crowned.</p>
<p>4 There dwells the Lord, our King,<br />
The Lord, our Righteousness,<br />
Triumphant o'er the world and sin,<br />
The Prince of Peace;<br />
On Zion's sacred height<br />
His kingdom he maintains,<br />
And, glorious with his saints in light,<br />
For ever reigns.</p>
<p>5 The God who reigns on high,<br />
The great archangels sing,<br />
And "Holy, holy, holy," cry,<br />
"Almighty King!"<br />
Who was and is the same,<br />
And evermore shall be:<br />
Jehovah, Father, great I AM,<br />
We worship thee."</p>
<p>6 The whole triumphant host<br />
Give thanks to God on high;<br />
"Hail, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost"<br />
They ever cry;<br />
Hail, Abraham's God and mine;<br />
I join the heavenly lays;<br />
All might and majesty are thine,<br />
And endless praise!</p>

Only Thou art holy, there is none beside Thee,<br />
Perfect in power, in love, and purity.</p>

Bow down before Him, His glory proclaim;<br />
Gold of obedience, and incense of lowliness,<br />

Comfort thy sorrows, and answer thy prayerfulness,<br />

<p>3 Fear not to enter His courts in the slenderness<br />
Of the poor wealth thou wouldst reckon as thine;<br />
Truth in its beauty, and love in its tenderness,<br />
These are the offerings to lay on His shrine.</p>
<p>4 These, though we bring them in trembling and fearfulness,<br />
He will accept for the name that is dear;<br />
Mornings of joy give for evenings of tearfulness,<br />
Trust for our trembling, and hope for our fear.</p>

<p>1 Eternal Light! Eternal Light!<br />
How pure the soul must be<br />
When, placed within Thy searching sight,<br />
It shrinks not, but with calm delight<br />
Can live, and look on Thee.</p>
<p>2 The spirits that surround Thy throne<br />
May bear the burning bliss;<br />
But that is surely theirs alone,<br />
Since they have never, never known<br />
A fallen world like this.</p>
<p>3 0h, how shall I, whose native sphere<br />
Is dark, whose mind is dim,<br />
Before the Ineffable appear,<br />
And on my naked spirit bear<br />
The uncreated beam?</p>
<p>4 There is a way for man to rise<br />
To that sublime abode;<br />
An Offering and a Sacrifice,<br />
A Holy Spirit's energies,<br />
An Advocate with God:</p>
<p>5 These, these prepare us for the sight<br />
Of holiness above;<br />
The sons of ignorance and night<br />
May dwell in the eternal Light,<br />
Through the eternal Love.</p>

In all His words most wonderful;<br />

When all was sin and shame,<br />
A second Adam to the fight<br />

Which did in Adam fail,<br />
Should strive afresh against the foe,<br />
Should strive and should prevail.</p>

Should flesh and blood refine,<br />
God's presence, and His very self<br />

In Man for man the foe,<br />
The double agony in Man<br />
For man should undergo.</p>

And on the Cross on high,<br />
Should teach His brethren and inspire<br />
To suffer and to die.</p>

Thine arm, unseen, conveyed me safe,<br />
And led me up to man.</p>

With health renewed my face;<br />
And when in sins and sorrows sunk,<br />
Revived my soul with grace.</p>
<p>5 Ten thousand thousand precious gifts<br />
My daily thanks employ;<br />
Nor is the least a cheerful heart<br />
That tastes those gifts with joy.</p>
<p>6 Through every period of my life<br />
Thy goodness I'll pursue;<br />
And after death, in distant worlds,<br />
The glorious theme renew.</p>
<p>7 Through all eternity to Thee<br />
A joyful song I'll raise;<br />
But oh, eternity's too short<br />
To utter all Thy praise!</p>

Declare, oh, declare ye His glories abroad,<br />
Proclaim ye His mercy, from nation to nation<br />
Till the uttermost islands have heard His salvation.</p>
<p><em>For His love floweth on, free and full as a river;<br />
And His mercy endureth, for ever and ever.</em></p>
<p>2 Praise, praise ye the Lamb who for sinners was slain;<br />
Who went down to the grave, and ascended again;<br />
And who soon shall return, when these dark days are o'er,<br />
To set up His kingdom, in glory and power.</p>
<p>3 Then the heav'ns and the earth and the sea shall rejoice;<br />
The field and the forest shall lift their glad voice;<br />
The sands of the desert shall flourish in green,<br />
And Lebanon's glory be shed o'er the scene.</p>
<p>4 Her bridal attire, and her festal array,<br />
All nature shall wear on that glorious day;<br />
For her King cometh down, with His people to reign,<br />
And His presence shall bless her with Eden again.</p>

<p>1 With harps and with vials there stands a great throng<br />
In the presence of Jesus, and sing this new song :</p>
<p><em>Unto Him who hath loved us and wash'd us from sin,<br />
Unto Him be the glory for ever.<br />
Amen.</em></p>
<p>2 All these once were sinners, defiled in His sight,<br />
Now arrayed in pure garments in praise they unite.</p>
<p>3 He maketh the rebel a priest and a king,<br />
He hath bought us, and taught us this new song to sing.</p>
<p>4 How helpless and hopeless we sinners had been,<br />
If He never had loved us, till cleansed from our sin.</p>

So that others, believing, this new song shall sing.</p>

<p>1 I cannot tell why He, whom angels worship,<br />
Should set His love upon the sons of men,<br />
Or why, as Shepherd, He should seek the wanderers,<br />
To bring them back, they know not how or when,<br />
But this I know, that He was born of Mary,<br />
When Bethlehem’s manger was His only home.<br />
And that He lived at Nazareth and laboured,<br />
And so the Saviour, Saviour of the world, is come.</p>
<p>2 I cannot tell how silently He suffered,<br />
As with His peace He graced this place of tears,<br />
Or how His heart upon the cross was broken,<br />
The crown of pain to three and thirty years.<br />
But this I know, He heals the broken-hearted,<br />
And stays our sin, and calms our lurking fear,<br />
And lifts the burden from the heavy laden.<br />
For yet the Saviour, Saviour of the world, is here.</p>
<p>3 I cannot tell how He will win the nations,<br />
How He will claim His earthly heritage,<br />
How satisfy the needs and aspirations<br />
Of east and west, of sinner and of sage.<br />
But this I know, all flesh shall see His glory,<br />
And He shall reap the harvest He has sown,<br />
And some glad day His sun shall shine in splendour<br />
When He the Saviour, Saviour of the world, is known.</p>

Our beauty Thou, our glorious dress;<br />
'Midst flaming worlds, whilst thus arrayed,<br />
With joy shall we lift up our head.</p>
<p>2 Bold shall we stand in that great day,<br />
For who aught to our charge shall lay?<br />
While by Thy blood absolved we are<br />
From sin’s tremendous curse and fear.</p>
<p>3 Thus Abraham, the friend of God,<br />
Thus all the saints redeemed by blood,<br />
Saviour of sinners Thee proclaim,<br />
And all their boast is in Thy name.</p>

<p>1 Jesus, Lord, we know Thee present<br />
At Thy table freshly spread,<br />
Seated at Thy priceless banquet,<br />
With Thy banner overhead.<br />
Precious moments at Thy table,<br />
From all fear and doubt set free;<br />
Here to rest, so sweetly able<br />
Occupied alone with Thee.</p>
<p>2 Here rejoicing in Thy nearness,<br />
Gladly by Thy Spirit led;<br />
Calmly in the blest remembrance<br />
Of Thy precious blood once shed.<br />
Lord, we take each simple token<br />
In fond memory of Thee;<br />
Muse upon Thy body broken,<br />
And Thy blood shed on the tree.</p>
<p>3 Oh what joy it is to see Thee,<br />
In these emblems gathered here!<br />
In the bread and wine of blessing,<br />
Bread to strengthen, wine to cheer.<br />
Lord, behold us met together,<br />
Members of our risen Head,<br />
Thus to take the cup of blessing,<br />
Thus to share the broken bread.</p>
<p>4 Lord, we know how true Thy promise<br />
To be with us where we meet,<br />
When in Thy loved Name we gather<br />
To enjoy communion sweet,<br />
Dearer still that looked-for promise<br />
To each waiting, yearning heart,<br />
That we soon will be with Thee, Lord<br />
And forever where Thou art.</p>

At Thy grace we are confounded,<br />
Holy, spotless Lamb of God.</p>

Bound to the accursed tree,<br />

<p>1 O come, Thou stricken Lamb of God!<br />
Who shed’st for us Thine own life-blood,<br />
And teach us all Thy love: then pain<br />
Were sweet, and life or death were gain.</p>
<p>2 Take Thou our hearts, and let them be<br />
For ever closed to all but Thee;<br />
Thy willing servants, let us wear<br />
The seal of love for ever there.</p>
<p>3 How blest are they who still abide<br />
Close sheltered by Thy watchful side;<br />
Who life and strength from Thee receive,<br />
And with Thee move, and in Thee live!</p>
<p>4 Ah, Lord! enlarge our scanty thought<br />
To know the wonders Thou hast wrought;<br />
Unloose our stamm’ring tongues to tell<br />
Thy love, immense, unsearchable.</p>
<p>5 First-born of many brethren, Thou!<br />
To whom both heaven and earth must bow!<br />
Heirs of Thy shame and of Thy throne,<br />
We bear the cross, and seek the crown.</p>

<p>1 O My Saviour, crucified!<br />
Near Thy Cross would I abide,<br />
There to look with steadfast eye<br />
On Thy dying agony.</p>
<p>2 Jesus bruised and put to shame,<br />
Tells us all Jehovah’s Name:<br />
God is love, I surely know<br />
By the Saviour’s depths of woe.</p>
<p>3 In His spotless soul’s distress<br />
We perceive our guiltiness;<br />
O how vile our low estate!<br />
Since our ransom was so great.</p>

Contrite shall our spirits be;<br />
Rest and holiness shall find,<br />
Fashioned like our Saviour’s mind.</p>

<p>1 O Head, once filled with bruises,<br />
Oppressed with pain and scorn,<br />
O'erwhelmed with sore abuses,<br />
Mocked with a crown of thorn!<br />
O Head, to death once wounded<br />
In shame upon the tree,<br />
In glory now surrounded<br />
With brightest majesty!</p>
<p>2 Thou Lord of all transcendent,<br />
Thou life-creating Sun<br />
To worlds on Thee dependent,<br />
Yet bruised and spit upon!<br />
O Lord! what Thee tormented<br />
Was our sin's heavy load;<br />
We had the debt augmented,<br />
Which Thou didst pay in blood.</p>
<p>3 We give thee thanks unfeigned,<br />
Lord Jesus, Friend in need!<br />
For what Thy soul sustained<br />
When Thou for us didst bleed;<br />
Grant us to lean unshaken<br />
Upon Thy faithfulness,<br />
Until, to glory taken,<br />
We see Thee face to face.</p>

<p>1 0 Lord my God! When I in awesome wonder<br />
Consider all the works Thy hand hath made,<br />
I see the stars, I hear the mighty thunder,<br />
Thy power throughout the universe displayed.</p>
<p><em>Then sings my soul my Saviour God to Thee<br />
How great Thou art! How great Thou art!<br />
Then sings my soul my Saviour God to Thee<br />
How great Thou art! How great Thou art!</em></p>
<p>2 When through the woods and forest glades I wander<br />
And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees;<br />
When I look down from lofty mountain grandeur<br />
And hear the brook, and feel the gentle breeze.</p>
<p>3 And when I think: that God, His Son not sparing<br />
Sent Him to die—I scarce can take it in;<br />
That on the cross, my burden gladly bearing<br />
He bled and died, to take away my sin:</p>
<p>4 When Christ shall come with shout of acclamation<br />
And take me home—what joy shall fill my heart<br />
Then shall I bow in humble adoration,<br />
And there proclaim, my God how great Thou art!</p>

All merit of their own deny,<br />

The only song in that blest place<br />
Is, “Thou art worthy! Thou alone!”</p>
<p>2 With spotless robes of purest white,<br />
And branches of triumphal palm,<br />
They shout, with transports of delight,<br />
Heaven’s ceaseless, universal psalm:<br />
“Salvation’s glory all be paid<br />
To Him who sits upon the throne,<br />
And to the Lamb whose blood was shed;<br />
Thou! Thou art worthy! Thou alone!</p>
<p>3 “For Thou wast slain, and in Thy blood<br />
These robes were washed so spotless pure:<br />
Thou mad’st us kings and priests to God,<br />
For ever let Thy praise endure.”<br />

Shame need now no more alarm us,<br />
Glad we follow, nought can harm us<br />

Low we bow in adoration<br />

Outside the camp,<br />
Forth we hasten, fear no danger<br />
Outside the camp.<br />
Thy reproach, far richer treasure<br />
Than all Egypt’s boasted pleasure;<br />
Drawn by love that knows no measure,<br />
Outside the camp.</p>
<p>5 Soon Thy saints shall all be gathered<br />
Inside the veil:<br />
All at home, no more be scattered,<br />
Inside the veil.<br />
Nought from Thee our hearts shall sever:<br />
We shall see Thee, grieve Thee never;<br />
“Praise the Lamb!” shall sound for ever<br />

So many glorious things are here,<br />
Noble and right.</p>
<p>2 I thank Thee, too, that Thou hast made<br />
Joy to abound.<br />
So many gentle thoughts and deeds<br />
Circling us round,<br />
That, in the darkest spot of earth<br />
Some love is found.</p>
<p>3 I thank Thee more, that all our joy<br />
Is touched with pain,<br />
That shadows fall on brightest hours,<br />
That thorns remain,<br />
So that earth’s bliss may be our guide,<br />
And not our chain.</p>
<p>4 For Thou, who knowest, Lord, how soon<br />
Our weak heart clings,<br />
Hast given us joys, tender and true,<br />
Yet all with wings.<br />
So that we see, gleaming on high<br />
Diviner things.</p>
<p>5 I thank Thee, Lord, that Thou hast kept<br />
The best in store:<br />
We have enough, yet not too much<br />
To long for more, —<br />
A yearning for a deeper peace<br />
Not known before.</p>
<p>6 I thank Thee, Lord, that here our souls,<br />
Though amply blest,<br />
Can never find, although they seek,<br />
A perfect rest,<br />
Nor ever shall, until they lean<br />
On Jesus’ breast.</p>

<p>1 It is a thing most wonderful,<br />
Almost too wonderful to be,<br />
That God’s own Son should come from heaven<br />
And die to save a child like me.</p>
<p>2 And yet I know that it is true:<br />
He came to this poor world below,<br />
And wept and toiled and mourned and died.<br />
Only because He loved us so.</p>
<p>3 I cannot tell how He could love<br />
A child so weak and full of sin;<br />
His love must be most wonderful,<br />
If He could die my love to win.</p>
<p>4 I sometimes think about His cross,<br />
And shut my eyes, and try to see<br />
The cruel nails, and crown of thorns.<br />
And Jesus crucified for me.</p>
<p>5 But even could I see Him die,<br />
I could but see a little part<br />
Of that great love, which, like a fire,<br />
Is always burning in His heart.</p>
<p>6 It is most wonderful to know<br />
His love for me so free and sure;<br />
But 'tis more wonderful to see<br />
My love for Him so faint and poor.</p>
<p>7 And yet I want to love Thee, Lord:<br />
Oh, light the flame within my heart,<br />
And I will love Thee more and more<br />
Until I see Thee as Thou art!</p>

Earthly cares can never vex me,<br />
neither trials lay me low:<br />
For when Satan comes to tempt me,<br />

There is cool and pleasant shelter,<br />
and a fresh and crystal spring;<br />
And my Saviour rests beside me,<br />

He says when thus we meet.</p>

my doubts and griefs and fears;<br />
Oh, how patiently He listens! and<br />
my drooping soul He cheers:<br />

what a ſalse friend He would be<br />
If He never, never told me of<br />
the sins which He must see!</p>

sweetness of the secret of the Lord?<br />
Go and hide beneath His shadow;<br />
this shall then be your reward:<br />
And whene'er you leave the silence<br />
of that happy meeting place,<br />
You will bear the shining image<br />
of the Master in your face.</p>

Mary was that mother mild.<br />
Jesus Christ her little Child.</p>

Who is God and Lord of all,<br />
And His shelter was a stable,<br />
And His cradle was a stall.<br />
With the poor, and mean, and lowly,<br />

He would honour and obey.<br />
Love and watch the lowly maiden<br />
In whose gentle arms He lay.<br />
Christian children all must be<br />
Mild, obedient, good as He.</p>
<p>4 For He is our childhood's pattern,<br />
Day by day like us He grew;<br />
He was little, weak, and helpless,<br />
Tears and smiles like us He knew;<br />
And He feeleth for our sadness,<br />
And He shareth in our gladness.</p>
<p>5 And our eyes at last shall see Him<br />
Through His own redeeming love,<br />
For that Child so dear and gentle<br />
Is our Lord in heaven above;<br />
And He leads His children on<br />

<p>1 We sing the praise of Him who died,<br />
Of Him who died upon the Cross:<br />
The sinner's hope let men deride:<br />
For this we count the world but loss.</p>
<p>2 Inscribed upon the Cross we see<br />
In shining letters, God is love':<br />
He bears our sins upon the tree:<br />
He brings us mercy from above.</p>
<p>3 The Cross: it takes our guilt away;<br />
It holds the fainting spirit up;<br />
It cheers with hope the gloomy day,<br />
And sweetens ev'ry bitter cup.</p>
<p>4 It makes the coward spirit brave,<br />
And nerves the feeble arm for fight;<br />
It takes its terror from the grave,<br />
And gilds the bed of death with light.</p>
<p>5 The balm of life, the cure of woe,<br />
The measure and the pledge of love,<br />
The sinner's refuge here below,<br />
The angels theme in heaven above.</p>

<p>1 Glory be to Jesus,<br />
Who in bitter pains<br />
Pour'd for me the life-blood<br />
From His sacred veins.</p>
<p>2 Grace and life eternal<br />
In that blood I find;<br />
Blest be His compassion,<br />
Infinitely kind.</p>
<p>3 Blest through endless ages<br />
Be the precious stream,<br />
Which from endless torments<br />
Did the world redeem.</p>
<p>4 Abel's blood for vengeance<br />
Pleaded to the skies;<br />
But the blood of Jesus<br />
For our pardon cries.</p>
<p>5 Oft as it is sprinkled<br />
On our guilty hearts,<br />
Satan in confusion<br />
Terror-struck departs.</p>
<p>6 Oft as earth exulting<br />
Wafts its praise on high,<br />
Angel-hosts rejoicing<br />
Make their glad reply.</p>

Swell the mighty flood;<br />
Louder still and louder<br />
Praise the precious blood.</p>

My richest gain I count but loss,<br />
And pour contempt on all my pride.</p>

Save in the Cross of Christ my God;<br />
All the vain things that charm me most,<br />
I sacrifice them to His blood.</p>

Sorrow and love flow mingled down;<br />

Or thorns compose so rich a crown?</p>

<p>1 0 Christ, what burdens bow'd Thy head!<br />
Our load was laid on Thee;<br />
Thou stoodest in the sinner's stead,<br />
Didst bear all ill for me.<br />
A Victim led, Thy blood was shed;<br />
Now there's no load for me.</p>
<p>2 Death and the curse were in our cup,<br />
O Christ, 'twas full for Thee!<br />
But Thou hast drain'd the last dark drop—<br />
'Tis empty now for me.<br />
That bitter cup—love drank it up;<br />
Now blessings' draught for me.</p>
<p>3 Jehovah lifted up His rod,<br />
O Christ, it fell on Thee!<br />
Thou wast sore stricken of Thy God;<br />
There's not one stroke for me.<br />
Thy tears, Thy blood, beneath it flowed;<br />
Thy bruising healeth me.</p>
<p>4 The tempest's awful voice was heard,<br />
O Christ, it broke on Thee!<br />
Thy open bosom was my ward,<br />
It braved the storm for me,<br />
Thy form was scarred, Thy visage marred;<br />
Now cloudless peace for me.</p>
<p>5 Jehovah bade His sword awake,<br />
O Christ, it woke 'gainst Thee!<br />
Thy blood the flaming blade must slake;<br />
Thy heart its sheath must be—<br />
All for my sake, my peace to make;<br />
Now sleeps that sword for me.</p>
<p>6 For me, Lord Jesus, Thou hast died,<br />
And I have died in Thee;<br />
Thou'rt risen: my bands are all untied,<br />
And now Thou liv'st in me.<br />
When purified, made white, and tried,<br />
Thy Glory then for me!</p>

<p>1 Beneath the Cross of Jesus,<br />
I fain would take my stand,<br />
The shadow of a mighty Rock,<br />
Within a weary land:<br />
A home within the wilderness,<br />
A rest upon the way,<br />
From the burning of the noontide heat,<br />
And the burden of the day.</p>
<p>2 Oh, safe and happy shelter!<br />
Oh, refuge tried and sweet!<br />
Oh, trysting place where heaven's love<br />
And heaven's justice meet.<br />
As to the holy patriarch<br />
That wondrous dream was given,<br />
So seems my Saviour's Cross to me<br />
A ladder up to heaven.</p>
<p>3 There lies beneath its shadow,<br />
But on the farther side,<br />
The darkness of an awful grave<br />
That gapes both deep and wide;<br />
And there between us stands the Cross,<br />
Two arms outstretch'd to save,<br />
Like a watchman set to guard the way<br />
From that eternal grave.</p>
<p>4 Upon that Cross of Jesus<br />
Mine eye at times can see<br />
The very dying form of One,<br />
Who suffered there for me;<br />
And from my smitten heart, with tears,<br />
Two wonders I confess,<br />
The wonders of His glorious love,<br />
And my own worthlessness.</p>
<p>5 I take, O Cross, Thy shadow<br />
For my abiding place;<br />
I ask no other sunshine than<br />
The sunshine of His face;<br />
Content to let the world go by,<br />
To know no gain nor loss,<br />
My sinful self my only shame,<br />
My glory all the Cross.</p>

Learn Thy love while gazing thus:<br />
Sin, which laid the cross on Thee;<br />
Love, which bore the cross for us.</p>

And, rejoicing, self deny;<br />

Where our earliest hopes began,<br />

Through Thy cross made pure and white<br />
Cast our crowns before Thy feet.</p>

<p>1 A lamp in the night, a song in time of sorrow,<br />
A great glad hope which faith can ever borrow<br />
To gild the passing day with the glory of the morrow,<br />
Is the hope of the coming of the Lord.</p>
<p><em>Blessed hope, blessed hope,<br />
Blessed hope of the coming of the Lord;<br />
How the aching heart it cheers;<br />
How it glistens thro' our tears,<br />
Blessed hope of the coming of the Lord.</em></p>
<p>2 A star in the sky, a beacon bright to guide us;<br />
An anchor sure to hold when storms betide us;<br />
A refuge for the soul, where in quiet we may hide us,<br />
Is the hope of the coming of the Lord.</p>
<p>3 A call of command, like trumpet clearly sounding,<br />
To make us bold when evil is surrounding;<br />
To stir the sluggish heart, and to keep in good abounding,<br />
Is the hope of the coming of the Lord.</p>
<p>4 A word from the One to all our hearts the dearest,<br />
A parting word to make Him aye the nearest;<br />
Of all His precious words, the Sweetest, brightest, clearest,<br />
Is the hope of the coming of the Lord,</p>

<p>1 There's a light upon the mountains,<br />
and the day is at the spring,<br />
When our eyes shall see the beauty<br />
and the glory of the King;<br />
Weary was our heart with waiting,<br />
and the night-watch seemed so long,<br />
But His triumph-day is breaking,<br />
and we hail it with a song.</p>
<p>2 In the fading of the starlight we<br />
can see the coming morn;<br />
And the lights of men are paling<br />
in the splendours of the dawn;<br />
For the eastern skies are glowing<br />
as with lights of hidden fire,<br />
And the hearts of men are stirring<br />
with the throb of deep desire.</p>
<p>3 There's a hush of expectation, and<br />
a quiet in the air;<br />
And the breath of God is moving<br />
in the fervent breath of prayer;<br />
For the suff'ring, dying Jesus is<br />
the Christ upon the throne,<br />
And the travail of our spirits is<br />
the travail of His own.</p>
<p>4 He is breaking down the barriers,<br />
He is casting up the way;<br />
He is calling for His angels to build<br />
up the gates of day;<br />
But His angels here are human,<br />
not the shining hosts above,<br />
For the drum-beats of His army<br />
are the heart-beats of our love.</p>
<p>5 Hark! we hear a distant music,<br />
and it comes with fuller swell;<br />
'Tis the triumph song of Jesus,<br />
of our King Emmanuel;<br />
Zion, go ye forth to meet Him,<br />
and my soul, be swift to bring<br />
All thy sweetest and thy dearest<br />
for the triumph of our King.</p>

<p>1 It may be at morn, when the day is awaking,<br />
When sunlight through darkness and shadow is breaking<br />
That Jesus will come in the fulness of glory,<br />
To receive from the world His own.</p>
<p>O Lord Jesus, how long?<br />
How long ere we shout the glad song?<br />
Christ returneth, Hallelujah!<br />
Hallelujah ! Amen.</p>
<p>2 It may be at midday, it may be at twilight,<br />
It may be, perchance, that the blackness of midnight<br />
Will burst into light in the blaze of His glory,<br />
When Jesus receives His own.</p>
<p>3 While hosts cry Hosanna! from heaven descending,<br />
With glorified saints and the angels attending,<br />
With grace on His brow, like a halo of glory,<br />
Will Jesus receive His own.</p>
<p>4 Oh, joy, oh, delight! should we go without dying;<br />
No sickness, no sadness, no dread, and no crying;<br />
Caught up through the clouds with our Lord into glory,<br />
When Jesus receives His own.</p>

And by the few enthroned;<br />
But soon He'll come in glory!<br />
The hour is drawing nigh,<br />
For the crowning day is coming<br />

But brighter far than they,<br />
The saints shall shine in glory,<br />
As Christ shall them array;<br />
The beauty of the Saviour<br />
Shall dazzle every eye,<br />
In the crowning day that's coming<br />
By-and-by.</p>
<p>3 Our pain shall then be over,<br />
We'll sin and sigh no more,<br />
Behind us all of sorrow,<br />
And naught but joy before:<br />
A joy in our Redeemer,<br />
As we to Him are nigh,<br />
In the crowning day that's coming<br />
By-and-by.</p>
<p>4 Let all that look for hasten<br />
The coming joyful day,<br />
By earnest consecration,<br />
To walk the narrow way:<br />
By gathering in the lost ones,<br />
For whom our Lord did die,<br />
For the crowning day that's coming<br />
By-and-by.</p>

And righteousness, in fountains,<br />

Seems the world so poor and vast?<br />
All our life-joy overcast?<br />
Hush! be every murmur dumb,<br />

Would we have one sorrow less?<br />
All the sharpness of the Cross,<br />
All that tells the world is loss,<br />
Death, and darkness, and the tomb,<br />
Only whisper, 'Till He come!"</p>

Of all those waves and billows,<br />
Which rolled across Thy breast.<br />
Oh, there Thy grace unbounded<br />
And, perfect love we see;<br />
With joy and sorrow mingling,<br />
We would remember Thee.</p>

The Firstborn from the dead;<br />

The heart and mind set free<br />
To think of all Thy sorrow,<br />
And thus remember Thee.</p>

And call us hence away,<br />
To rest in all the brightness<br />

<p>1 Come, Thou everlasting Spirit,<br />
Bring to every thankful mind<br />
All the Saviour's dying merit,<br />
All His sufferings for mankind:<br />
True Recorder of His passion,<br />
Now the living faith impart;<br />
Now reveal His great salvation<br />
Unto every faithful heart.</p>
<p>2 Come, Thou witness of His dying;<br />
Come, Remembrancer Divine;<br />
Let us feel Thy power applying<br />
Christ to every soul, and mine;<br />
Let us groan Thine inward groaning;<br />
Look on Him we pierced, and grieve;<br />
All partake the grace atoning —<br />
All the sprinkled blood receive.</p>
<p>3 Yes, in me, in me He dwelleth;<br />
I in Him, and He in me!<br />
And my empty soul He filleth,<br />
Here and through eternity.<br />
Thus I wait for His returning,<br />
Singing all the way to heaven;<br />
Such the joyous song of morning,<br />
Such the banquet song of even.</p>

Come for a cleansing to Calvary's tide,<br />
There's wonderful power in the blood.</p>
<p>3 Would you be whiter, much whiter than snow?<br />
There's power in the blood, power in the blood;<br />
Sin-stains are lost in its life-giving flow,<br />
There's wonderful power in the blood.</p>
<p>4 Would you do service for Jesus your King?<br />
There's power in the blood, power in the blood;<br />
Would you live daily His praises to sing?<br />
There's wonderful power in the blood.</p>

<p>1 There is no love like the love of Jesus;<br />
Never to fade or fall,<br />
Till into the fold of the house of God<br />
He has gather'd us all.</p>
<p><em>Jesus' love! precious love!<br />
Boundless, and pure, and free;<br />
Oh, turn to that love, weary wand'ring soul,<br />
Jesus pleadeth with thee!</em></p>
<p>2 There is no heart like the heart of Jesus,<br />
Fill'd with a tender love;<br />
No throb nor throe that our hearts can know,<br />
But He feels it above.</p>
<p>3 There is no eye like the eye of Jesus,<br />
Piercing so far away;<br />
Ne'er out of the sight of its tender light<br />
Can the wanderer stray.</p>
<p>4 There is no voice like the voice of Jesus,<br />
Tender and sweet its chime;<br />
Like musical ring of a flowing spring<br />
In the bright summer-time.</p>
<p>5 Oh, let us hark to the voice of Jesus!<br />
Then we shall never roam;<br />
And we shall rest on His loving breast,<br />
In our heavenly home.</p>

Do not longer try to feel;<br />

Full of wickedness within,<br />
In the darkness of despair, regret and loss;<br />
When I heard a gentle voice<br />
And it made my heart rejoice:<br />
"Come, find rest, thou heavy laden, at the cross."</p>
<p><em>At the cross, at the cross,<br />
There my sins were all forgiven at the cross;<br />
There my burdens rolled away,<br />
There my night was turned to day,<br />
There I met my blessed Saviour at the cross.</em></p>
<p>2 Now each day I go to Him<br />
To receive new life within<br />
And be filled with grace and power at the cross;<br />
So that when temptations come,<br />
All my victories may be won<br />
On my knees in humble prayer at the cross.</p>
<p>3 When the way seems long and drear,<br />
Sore depressed and full of fear,<br />
I just stand and gaze in wonder at the cross;<br />
When I see His pain and woe,<br />
All for love of me I know,<br />
Joy and strength become my portion at the cross.</p>

Come to Jesus' side to stay;<br />
In His blood He'll wash your sin stains all away.<br />
You will find your life abound<br />
When in brokenness you're found<br />
Owning oneness with your Saviour at the cross.</p>

<p>1 Sovereign grace! o'er sin abounding,<br />
Ransomed souls the tidings swell;<br />
'Tis a deep that knows no sounding—<br />
Who its breadth or length can tell?<br />
On its glories<br />
Let my soul for ever dwell!</p>
<p>2 What from Christ His saints can sever,<br />
Bound by everlasting bands?<br />
Once in Him, in Him for ever,<br />
Thus th'eternal cov'nant stands;<br />
None shall pluck them<br />
From the Strength of Israel's hands.</p>
<p>3 Heirs of God, joint heirs with Jesus,<br />
Long ere time its course begun;<br />
To His Name eternal praises!<br />
Oh what wonders love hath done!<br />
One with Jesus;<br />
By eternal union one.</p>
<p>4 On such love, my soul, still ponder—<br />
Love so great, so rich, so free!<br />
Say, while lost in holy wonder—<br />
Why, O Lord, such love to me?<br />
Hallelujah!<br />
Grace shall reign eternally.</p>

He sunders the bands that enthral,<br />
Redeemed by His blood, why should we ever fear,<br />
Since Jesus is our all in all?</p>
<p>If God be for us, if God be for us.<br />
If God be for us,<br />
Who can be against us?<br />
Who? who? who?<br />
Who can be against us?</p>

Be loyal and true day by day;<br />
When evils assail, be valiant for the right,<br />
And He will be our strength and Stay.</p>
<p>3 Confide in His word, His promise so sure;<br />
In Christ they are yea and amen:<br />
Though earth pass away, they ever shall endure,<br />
'Tis written o'er and o'er again.</p>
<p>4 Abide in the Lord : secure in His control,<br />
'Tis life everlasting begun;<br />
To pluck from His hand the weakest, trembling soul,<br />
It never, never can be done!</p>

<p>1 Arise, my soul, arise,<br />
Shake off thy guilty fears;<br />
The bleeding Sacrifice<br />
In my behalf appears:<br />
Before the throne my Surety stands;<br />
My name is written on His hands.</p>
<p>2 He ever lives above,<br />
For me to intercede,<br />
His all redeeming love,<br />
His precious blood, to plead;<br />
His blood atoned for all our race,<br />
And sprinkles now the throne of grace.</p>
<p>3 Five bleeding wounds He bears,<br />
Received on Calvary;<br />
They pour effectual prayers,<br />
They strongly speak for me:<br />
‘Forgive him, O forgive!’ they cry,<br />
‘Nor let that ransomed sinner die!'</p>
<p>4 The Father hears Him pray,<br />
His dear Anointed One;<br />
He cannot turn away<br />
The presence of His Son:<br />
His Spirit answers to the blood,<br />
And tells me I am born of God.</p>
<p>5 My God is reconciled,<br />
His pardoning voice I hear:<br />
He owns me for His child;<br />
I can no longer fear;<br />
With confidence I now draw nigh,<br />
And Father, Abba, Father! cry.</p>

An int'rest in the Saviour's blood?<br />
Died He for me, who caused His pain?<br />
For me, who Him to death pursued?<br />
Amazing love! how can it be<br />
That Thou, my God, shouldst die for me?</p>
<p>2 'Tis mystery all! The Immortal dies!<br />
Who can explore His strange design?<br />
In vain the first-born seraph tries<br />
To sound the depths of love divine!<br />
'Tis mercy all! let earth adore,<br />
Let angel minds inquire no more.</p>
<p>3 He left His Father's throne above,<br />
So free, so infinite His grace;<br />
Emptied Himself of all but love,<br />
And bled for Adam's helpless race:<br />
'Tis mercy all, immense and free;<br />
For, O my God, it found out me.</p>
<p>4 Long my imprisoned spirit lay<br />
Fast bound in sin and nature's night;<br />
Thine eye diffused a quickening ray,<br />
I woke, the dungeon flamed with light;<br />
My chains fell off, my heart was free;<br />
I rose, went forth, and followed Thee.</p>
<p>5 No condemnation now I dread;<br />
Jesus, and all in Him, is mine!<br />
Alive in Him, my living Head,<br />
And clothed in righteousness divine,<br />
Bold I approach the eternal throne,<br />
And claim the crown, through Christ my own.</p>

<p>1 Now I have found the ground wherein<br />
Sure my soul's anchor may remain—<br />
The wounds of Jesus, for my sin<br />
Before the world's foundation slain,<br />
Whose mercy shall unshaken stay,<br />
When heaven and earth are fled away.</p>
<p>2 Father, Thine everlasting grace<br />
Our scanty thought surpasses far;<br />
Thy heart still melts with tenderness,<br />
Thy arms of love still open are<br />
Returning sinners to receive,<br />
That mercy they may taste and live.</p>
<p>3 O Love, Thou bottomless abyss,<br />
My sins are swallowed up in thee!<br />
Covered is my unrighteousness,<br />
Nor spot of guilt remains on me,<br />
While Jesus' blood through earth and skies<br />
Mercy, free boundless mercy! cries.</p>
<p>4 With faith I plunge me in this sea,<br />
Here is my hope, my joy, my rest;<br />
Hither, when hell assails, I flee,<br />
I look into my Saviour's breast:<br />
Away, sad doubt and anxious fear!<br />
Mercy is all that's written there.</p>
<p>5 Though waves and storms go o'er my head,<br />
Though strength, and health, and friends be gone,<br />
Though joys be withered all and dead,<br />
Though every comfort be withdrawn,<br />
On this my steadfast soul relies—<br />
Father, Thy mercy never dies!</p>
<p>6 Fixed on this ground will I remain,<br />
Though my heart fail and flesh decay;<br />
This anchor shall my soul sustain,<br />
When earth's foundations melt away:<br />
Mercy's full power I then shall prove,<br />
Loved with an everlasting love.</p>

This blood-sealed friendship changes not,<br />

Upward I look, and see Him there<br />
Who made an end of all my sin.</p>

My sinful soul is counted free;<br />
For God, the Just, is satisfied<br />

Triumphant saints no honour claim;<br />

Through weakness and defeat,<br />
He won the meed and crown;<br />
Trod all our foes beneath His feet,<br />

Made sin, He sin o'erthrew;<br />
Bowed to the grave, destroyed it so,<br />

To harass and appal;<br />
Let but my Advocate appear,<br />
Backward they go, and fall.<br />

They set their fierce array,<br />
To fight and force me from the ground<br />
Along Immanuel's way.</p>

Through Jesus' conquest blest;<br />
March in the triumph of His grace,<br />

Since Jesus came into my heart!<br />
I have light in my soul for which long I had sought,<br />
Since Jesus came into my heart!</p>
<p><em>Since Jesus came into my heart,<br />

Since Jesus came into my heart!<br />
And my sins which were many are all washed away<br />
Since Jesus came into my heart!</p>
<p>3 I'm possessed of a hope that is steadfast and sure,<br />
Since Jesus came into my heart!<br />
And no dark clouds of doubt now my pathway obscure,<br />
Since Jesus came into my heart!</p>
<p>4 There's a light in the valley of Death now for me,<br />
Since Jesus came into my heart!<br />
And the gates of the City beyond I can see,<br />
Since Jesus came into my heart!</p>
<p>5 I shall go there to dwell in that City I know,<br />
Since Jesus came into my heart!<br />
And I'm happy, so happy as onward I go,<br />

<p>1 Will your anchor hold in the storms of life?<br />
When the clouds unfold their wings of strife;<br />
When the strong tides lift and the cables strain,<br />
Will your anchor drift, or firm remain?</p>
<p><em>We have an anchor that keeps the soul<br />
Steadfast and sure while the billows roll;<br />
Fastened to the Rock which cannot move,<br />
Grounded firm and deep in the Saviour's love!</em></p>
<p>2 Will your anchor hold in the straits of fear?<br />
When the breakers roar and the reef is near;<br />
While the surges rave, and the wild winds blow,<br />
Shall the angry waves then your bark o'erflow?</p>
<p>3 Will your anchor hold in the floods of death,<br />
When the waters cold chill your latest breath?<br />
On the rising tide you can never fail,<br />
While your anchor holds within the veil.</p>
<p>4 Will your eyes behold through the morning light<br />
The city of gold, and the harbour bright?<br />
Will you anchor safe by the heavenly shore,<br />
When life's storms are past for evermore?</p>

Till Thou hast made it Thine;<br />

When on Thy bosom it has leant,<br />

All my being's ransomed powers;<br />
All my thoughts and words and doings,<br />
All my days and all my hours.</p>
<p>2 Let my hands perform His bidding;<br />
Let my feet run in His ways;<br />
Let mine eyes see Jesus only;<br />
Let my lips speak forth His praise.</p>
<p>3 Worldlings prize their gems of beauty;<br />
Cling to gilded toys of dust;<br />
Boast of wealth, and fame, and pleasure;<br />
Only Jesus will I trust.</p>
<p>4 Since mine eyes were fixed on Jesus,<br />
I've lost sight of all beside;<br />
So enchained my spirit's vision,<br />
Looking at the Crucified.</p>
<p>5 Oh, what wonder! how amazing!<br />
Jesus, glorious King of kings,<br />
Deigns to call me His beloved<br />
Lets me rest beneath His wings.</p>

Fill me with Thy love and power,<br />

Rivers that flow from the throne.<br />
Rivers o'erflowing with blessing,<br />
Coming from Jesus alone.</p>
<p><em>Rivers of living water,<br />
Rivers of life so free,<br />
Flowing from Thee my Saviour —<br />

Here is abundant supply;<br />
Water transparent as crystal,<br />
Come without money and buy.</p>
<p>3 Cleanse me, oh, cleanse me, my Saviour,<br />
Make me a channel to-day;<br />
Empty me, fill me and use me,<br />
Teach me to trust and obey!</p>
<p>4 Then, and then only, Lord Jesus,<br />
Through me the rivers can flow:<br />
Thus and thus only will others<br />
Learn Thy great fulness to know.</p>

Here I lay at His feet;<br />
Anything, anywhere only<br />
Just for His service made meet!</p>

Sin is dethroned, and Christ takes its place.<br />

Nay, wherefore wait? the vessel marred and broken<br />
Shall now be moulded by the Potter's hand.</p>

Seed sown in conscious weakness, raised in power,<br />
Thy life lived out in days of toil and friction,<br />
"Not I, but Christ" in me — from hour to hour.</p>

A pilgrim path and lonely,<br />
Trodden by those who glory in the Cross;<br />
They live in fellowship with "Jesus only"<br />
And for His sake count earthly gain but loss.</p>

Bearing the living water, brimming o'er<br />

With His manna He my hungry soul shall fill.<br />
When crowned at last in glory,<br />
I'll see His blessed face,<br />
Where rivers of delight shall ever roll.<br />

<p>1 The King of Love my Shepherd is,<br />
Whose goodness faileth never;<br />
I nothing lack if I am His,<br />
And He is mine for ever.</p>
<p>2 Where streams of living water flow<br />
My ransom'd soul He leadeth,<br />
And, where the verdant pastures grow<br />
With food celestial feedeth.</p>
<p>3 Perverse and foolish oft I strayed,<br />
But yet in love He sought me,<br />
And on His shoulder gently laid,<br />
And home rejoicing brought me.</p>
<p>4 In death's dark vale I fear no ill<br />
With Thee, dear Lord, beside me<br />
Thy rod and staff my comfort still,<br />
Thy Cross before to guide me.</p>
<p>5 Thou spread'st a table in my sight;<br />
Thy unction grace bestoweth;<br />
And oh, what transport of delight<br />
From Thy pure chalice floweth!</p>
<p>6 And so through all the length of days<br />
Thy goodness faileth never;<br />
Good Shepherd, may I sing Thy praise<br />
Within Thy house for ever.</p>

Thou all-sufficient love divine;<br />
My help and refuge from my foes;<br />
Secure I am, if Thou art mine;<br />
And lo! from sin and grief and shame:<br />

And keeps my happy soul above;<br />
Comfort it brings, and power and peace,<br />
And joy and everlasting love;<br />

Pardon and holiness and heaven.</p>
<p>3 Jesus, my all in all Thou art,<br />
My rest in toil, my ease in pain;<br />
The med'cine of my broken heart;<br />
In war, my peace; in loss, my gain;<br />
My smile beneath the tyrant's frown:<br />
In shame, my glory and my crown:</p>

In weakness, my almighty power;<br />
In bonds, my perfect liberty;<br />
My light in Satan's darkest hour;<br />
In grief, my joy unspeakable;<br />
My life in death; my heaven, my all.</p>

In Thy sole glory may unite.</p>

Care, anguish, sorrow, melt away,<br />

O Jesus, nothing may I see,<br />

Leads on the path of God;<br />
Not where the flesh delighteth<br />
The feet of Jesus trod;</p>
<p>2 If now the path be narrow<br />
And steep and rough and lone,<br />

Praise God! we will go on.</p>

The fetters of the slave;<br />
To leave ourselves behind us,<br />
The grave-clothes and the grave;</p>
<p>4 To speed, unburdened pilgrims,<br />
Glad, empty-handed, free;<br />
To cross the trackless deserts,<br />
And walk upon the sea.</p>

Yet but a stretch of road,<br />
Then wondrous words of welcome,<br />
And then — The Face of God!</p>

<p>1 Not what I am, O Lord, but what Thou art;<br />
That, that alone, can be my soul's true rest;<br />
Thy love, not mine, bids fear and doubt depart,<br />
And stills the tempest of my tossing breast.</p>
<p>2 Thy name is Love! I hear it from yon Cross;<br />
Thy name is Love! I read it in yon tomb;<br />
All meaner love is perishable dross,<br />
But this shall light me through time's thickest gloom.</p>
<p>3 Girt with the love of God on every side,<br />
Breathing that love as heaven's own healing air,<br />
I work or wait, still following my Guide,<br />
Braving each foe, escaping every snare.</p>
<p>4'Tis what I know of Thee, my Lord and God,<br />
That fills my soul with peace, my lips with song;<br />
Thou art my health, my joy, my staff, my rod;<br />
Leaning on Thee, in weakness I am strong.</p>

More of Thy glory, O my God and Lord;<br />

<p>1 Lift up your heads, ye gates of brass;<br />
Ye bars of iron, yield;<br />
And let the King of Glory pass;<br />
The Cross is in the field.</p>
<p>2 That banner, brighter than the star<br />
That leads the train of night,<br />
Shines on the march, and guides from far<br />
His servants to the fight.</p>
<p>3 A holy war those servants wage;<br />
In that mysterious strife,<br />
The powers of heav'n and hell engage<br />
For more than death or life.</p>
<p>4 Ye armies of the living God,<br />
Sworn warriors of Christ's host,<br />
Where hallow'd footsteps never trod,<br />
Take your appointed post.</p>
<p>5 Though few and small and weak your bands,<br />
Strong in your Captain's strength,<br />
Go to the conquest of all lands:<br />
All must be His at length.</p>
<p>6 The spoils at His victorious feet<br />
You shall rejoice to lay,<br />
And lay yourselves as trophies meet,<br />
In His great judgment day.</p>
<p>7 Then fear not, faint not, halt not now:<br />
Quit you like men, be strong!<br />
To Christ shall all the nations bow,<br />
And sing the triumph song.</p>
<p>8 Uplifted are the gates of brass,<br />
The bars of iron vield;<br />
Behold the King of Glory pass;<br />
The Cross hath won the field.</p>

<p>1 Sound ye the trumpet-call;<br />
Heralds proclaim<br />
Jesus as Lord of all,<br />
Sound forth His fame:<br />
Tell of His great renown,<br />
Lift high the kingly crown,<br />
Let every knee bow down<br />
At His blest name.</p>
<p>2 Who will go forth for Him?<br />
Who will arise?<br />
Though eyes with tears are dim,<br />
Severed love's ties:<br />
Counting all things but loss,<br />
Earth's highest gain but dross,<br />
And glorying in the Cross,<br />
Who will arise?</p>
<p>3 Go, for the crowning day<br />
Draws ever near;<br />
Time will soon pass away,<br />
Jesus be here:<br />
Raise ye the Cross where now<br />
Nations to idols bow;<br />
Dawn o'er the mountain's brow<br />
Tells He is near.</p>
<p>4 Hark to the trumpet-blast!<br />
Jesus is King!<br />
He comes to reign at last,<br />
All conquering:<br />
Then the wide world shall own,<br />
Bending before His throne,<br />
Jesus is King alone,<br />
Jesus is King!</p>

Work, brethren, work!<br />
There's room enough for all,<br />
Work, brethren, work!<br />
This vineyard of our Lord<br />
Constant labour will afford;<br />
Yours is a sure reward:<br />
Work, brethren, work!</p>
<p>4 Hear we the Shepherd's voice,<br />
Pray, brethren, pray!<br />
Would ye His heart rejoice,<br />
Pray, brethren, pray!<br />
Sin calls for constant fear,<br />
Weakness needs the strong One near:<br />
Long as ye tarry here,<br />
Pray, brethren, pray!</p>
<p>5 Sound now the final chord,<br />
Praise, brethren, praise!<br />
Thrice holy is the Lord,<br />
Praise, brethren, praise!<br />
What more befits the tongues,<br />
Soon to lead the angels' songs,<br />
While heaven the note prolongs?<br />
Praise, brethren, praise!</p>

<p>1 Jesus calls us; o'er the tumult<br />
Of our life's wild, restless sea,<br />
Day by day His sweet voice soundeth,<br />
Saying, Christian, follow Me.</p>
<p>2 As of old apostles heard it<br />
By the Galilean lake,<br />
Turned from home and toil and kindred,<br />
Leaving all for His dear sake.</p>
<p>3 Jesus calls us from the worship<br />
Of the vain world's golden store:<br />
From each idol that would keep us,<br />
Saying, Christian, love Me more.</p>
<p>4 In our joys, and in our sorrows,<br />
Days of toil, and hours of ease,<br />
Still He calls, in cares and pleasures,<br />
Christian, love Me more than these.</p>
<p>5 Jesus calls us; by Thy mercies,<br />
Saviour, may we hear Thy call;<br />
Give our hearts to Thy obedience,<br />
Serve and love Thee best of all.</p>

<p>1 O Jesus, I have promised<br />
To serve Thee to the end;<br />
Be Thou for ever near me,<br />
My Master and my Friend;<br />
I shall not fear the battle<br />
If Thou art by my side,<br />
Nor wander from the pathway<br />

The world is ever near;<br />

The tempting sounds I hear;<br />
My foes are ever near me,<br />
Around me and within;<br />
But, Jesus, draw Thou nearer,<br />
And shield my soul from sin.</p>
<p>3 Oh, let me hear Thee speaking,<br />
In accents clear and still,<br />
Above the storms of passion,<br />
The murmurs of self-will;<br />
Oh, speak to reassure me,<br />
To hasten, or control;<br />
Oh, speak, and make me listen,<br />
Thou Guardian of my soul.</p>
<p>4 O Jesus, Thou hast promised<br />
To all who follow Thee<br />
That where Thou art in glory<br />
There shall Thy servant be;<br />
And, Jesus, I have promised<br />
To serve Thee to the end;<br />
Oh, give me grace to follow<br />
My Master and my Friend.</p>

<p>1 Down in the valley with my Saviour I would go,<br />
Where the flowers are blooming and the sweet waters flow;<br />
Everywhere He leads me I would follow, follow on,<br />
Walking in His footsteps till the crown be won.</p>
<p><em>Follow! follow! I would follow Jesus!<br />
Anywhere, everywhere, I would follow on!<br />
Follow! follow! I would follow Jesus!<br />
Everywhere He leads me I would follow on!</em></p>
<p>2 Down in the valley with my Saviour I would go,<br />
Where the storms are sweeping and the dark waters flow;<br />
With His hand to lead me I will never, never fear:<br />
Dangers cannot fright me if my Lord is near.</p>
<p>3 Down in the valley, or upon the mountain steep,<br />
Close beside my Saviour, would my soul ever keep;<br />
He will lead me safely, in the path that He has trod,<br />
Up to where they gather on the hills of God.</p>

'Gainst all disaster,<br />

Follow the Master.<br />
There's no discouragement<br />

His first avowed intent<br />
To be a pilgrim.</p>

With dismal stories,<br />
Do but themselves confound,<br />
His strength the more is.<br />
No foes shall stay his might,<br />
Though he with giants fight:<br />
He will make good his right<br />
To be a pilgrim.</p>

Us with Thy Spirit,<br />
We know we at the end<br />
Shall life inherit.<br />

<p>1 Soldiers of Christ, arise,<br />
And put your armour on,<br />
Strong in the strength which God supplies<br />
Through His eternal Son;<br />
Strong in the Lord of Hosts,<br />
And in His mighty power,<br />
Who in the strength of Jesus trusts<br />
Is more than conqueror.</p>
<p>2 Leave no unguarded place,<br />
No weakness of the soul;<br />
Take every virtue, every grace,<br />
And fortify the whole:<br />
To keep your armour bright,<br />
Attend with constant care,<br />
Still walking in your Captain's sight,<br />
And watching unto prayer.</p>
<p>3 But above all, lay hold<br />
On faith's victorious shield;<br />
Armed with the adamant and gold<br />
Be sure to win the field:<br />
If faith surrounds your heart,<br />
Satan shall be subdued;<br />
Repelled his every fiery dart,<br />
And quenched with Jesus' blood.</p>
<p>4 Stand then against your foes,<br />
In close and firm array;<br />
Legions of wily fiends oppose<br />
Throughout the evil day:<br />
Jesus hath died for you!<br />
What can His love withstand?<br />
Believe, hold fast your shield, and who<br />
Shall pluck you from His hand?</p>
<p>5 Stand then in His great might,<br />
With all His strength endued;<br />
And take, to arm you for the fight,<br />
The panoply of God;<br />
That, having all things done,<br />
And all your conflicts passed,<br />
Ye may o'ercome through Christ alone,<br />
And stand complete at last.</p>

Let the standard be displayed!<br />
And beneath its folds, as soldiers of the Lord,<br />

His name is all my trust;<br />
Nor will He put my soul to shame,<br />

And He can well secure<br />
What I've committed to His hands,<br />
Till the decisive hour.</p>

Before His Father's face;<br />

Give me the child-like praying love,<br />
Which longs to build Thy house again;<br />
Thy love, let it my heart o'erpower<br />
And all my simple soul devour.</p>
<p>2 I would the precious time redeem,<br />
And longer live for this alone,<br />
To spend, and to be spent, for them<br />
Who have not yet my Saviour known;<br />
Fully on these my mission prove,<br />
And only breathe, to breathe Thy love.</p>
<p>3 My talents, gifts, and graces, Lord,<br />
Into Thy blessed hands receive;<br />
And let me live to preach Thy word,<br />
And let me to Thy glory live;<br />
My every sacred moment spend<br />
In publishing the sinners' Friend.</p>
<p>4 Enlarge, inflame, and fill my heart<br />
With boundless charity divine:<br />
So shall I all my strength exert,<br />
And love them with a zeal like Thine;<br />
And lead them to Thy open side,<br />
The sheep for whom their Shepherd died.</p>

<p>1 How I praise Thee, precious Saviour<br />
That Thy love laid hold of me;<br />
Thou hast sav'd and cleans'd and fill'd me,<br />
That I might Thy channel be.</p>
<p><em>Channels only, blessed Master,<br />
But with all Thy wondrous pow'r<br />
Flowing through us, Thou canst use us<br />
Ev'ry day and ev'ry hour.</em></p>
<p>2 Just a channel, full of blessing,<br />
To the thirsty hearts around;<br />
To tell out Thy full salvation<br />
All Thy loving message sound.</p>
<p>3 Emptied that Thou shouldest fill me<br />
A clean vessel in Thine hand;<br />
With no pow'r but as Thou givest<br />
Graciously with each command.</p>
<p>4 Witnessing Thy power to save me,<br />
Setting free from self and sin;<br />
Thou hast bought me to possess me,<br />
In Thy fulness, Lord, come in.</p>
<p>5 Jesus, fill now with Thy Spirit<br />
Hearts that full surrender know;<br />
That the streams of living water<br />
From our inner man may flow.</p>

<p>1 There is always something over,<br />
When we trust our blessed Lord;<br />
Every cup He fills o'erfloweth,<br />
His great rivers all are broad.<br />
Nothing narrow, nothing stinted<br />
Ever issued from His store;<br />
To His own He gives full measure,<br />
Running over, evermore.</p>
<p>2 There is always something over<br />
When we, from the Father's hand,<br />
Take our portion with thanksgiving<br />
Praising for the path He planned.<br />
Satisfaction, full and deepening,<br />
Fills the soul, and lights the eye,<br />
When the heart has trusted Jesus<br />
All its needs to satisfy.</p>
<p>3 There is always something over,<br />
When we tell of all His love:<br />
Unplumbed depths still lie beneath us,<br />
Unscaled heights rise far above.<br />
Human lips can never utter<br />
All His wondrous tenderness,<br />
We can only praise and wonder<br />
And His Name for ever bless.</p>

<p>4 The hosts of God encamp around<br />
The dwellings of the just;<br />
Deliverance He affords to all<br />
Who on His succour trust.</p>
<p>5 Oh, make but trial of His love,<br />
Experience will decide<br />
How blest they are, and only they,<br />
Who in His truth confide.</p>
<p>6 Fear Him, ye saints; and you will then<br />
Have nothing else to fear;<br />
Make you His service your delight,<br />
Your wants shall be His care.</p>

<p>1 Through the love of God our Saviour,<br />
All will be well.<br />
Free and changeless is His favour;<br />
All, all is well.<br />
Precious is the blood that healed us,<br />
Perfect is the grace that sealed us,<br />
Strong the hand stretched forth to shield us,<br />
All must be well.</p>
<p>2 Though we pass through tribulation,<br />
All will be well.<br />
Ours is such a full salvation,<br />
All, all is well.<br />
Happy, still in God confiding,<br />
Fruitful, if in Christ abiding,<br />
Holy, through the Spirit's guiding,<br />
All must be well.</p>
<p>3 We expect a bright to-morrow,<br />
All will be well.<br />
Faith can sing through days of sorrow,<br />
All, all is well.<br />
On our Father's love relying,<br />
Jesus every need supplying,<br />
Or in living, or in dying,<br />
All must be well.</p>

<p>1 Yield not to temptation, for yielding is sin;<br />
Each victory will help you some other to win;<br />
Fight manfully onward, dark passions subdue,<br />
Look ever to Jesus, He'll carry you through.</p>
<p><em>Ask the Saviour to help you,<br />
Comfort, strengthen, and keep you;<br />
He is willing to aid you,<br />
He will carry you through.</em></p>
<p>2 Shun evil companions, bad language disdain,<br />
God's name hold in reverence, nor take it vain;<br />
Be thoughtful and earnest, kind-hearted and true,<br />
Look ever to Jesus, He'll carry you through.</p>
<p>3 To him that o'ercometh God giveth a crown,<br />
Through faith we shall conquer, though often cast down;<br />
He, who is our Saviour, our strength will renew;<br />
Look ever to Jesus, He'll carry you through.</p>

Never traitor stand;<br />

Not a shade of care,<br />
Not a blast of hurry,<br />
Touch the spirit there.</p>

Falleth from above,<br />
Traced upon our dial<br />

Find Him wholly true.</p>

No matter though the cost be oft-times great,<br />
He knoweth how I best shall reach the mark,<br />

The dawn of heaven breaks,<br />
The summer morn I've sighed for,<br />
The fair sweet morn awakes:<br />
Dark, dark hath been the midnight,<br />
But day-spring is at hand,<br />
And glory, glory dwelleth<br />
In Immanuel's land.</p>
<p>2 Oh, Christ, He is the fountain,<br />
The deep, sweet well of love:<br />
The streams on earth I've tasted,<br />
More deep I'll drink above.<br />
There, to an ocean fulness,<br />
His mercy doth expand,<br />
And glory, glory dwelleth<br />
In Immanuel's land.</p>
<p>3 Oh, I am my Beloved's,<br />
And my Beloved's mine;<br />
He brings a poor vile sinner<br />
Into His house of wine.<br />
I stand upon His merit;<br />
I know no other stand,<br />
Not e'en where glory dwelleth<br />
In Immanuel's land.</p>
<p>4The Bride eyes not her garment,<br />
But her dear Bridegroom's face;<br />
I will not gaze at glory,<br />
But on my King of grace:<br />
Not at the crown He giveth,<br />
But on His pierced hand;<br />
The Lamb is all the glory<br />
Of Immanuel's land.</p>
<p>5 The King there, in His beauty,<br />
Without a veil is seen;<br />
It were a well-spent journey,<br />
Though seven deaths lay between:<br />
The Lamb, with His fair army,<br />
Doth on Mount Zion stand,<br />
And glory, glory dwelleth<br />
In Immanuel's land.</p>
<p>6 With mercy and with judgment<br />
My web of time He wove,<br />
And aye the dews of sorrow<br />
Were lustred by His love;<br />
I'll bless the hand that guided,<br />
I'll bless the heart that planned,<br />
When throned where glory dwelleth<br />
In Immanuel's land.</p>

To reach the land I love,<br />
The bright inheritance of saints,<br />
Jerusalem above.</p>

The promise of that faithful word<br />
E'en here to me fulfil.<br />
Be Thou at my right hand,<br />

Uphold Thou me, and I shall stand;<br />
Fight, and I must prevail.</p>

Shall rend the veil in twain,<br />
By death I shall escape from death,<br />
And life eternal gain.<br />

They, with united breath,<br />
Ascribe their conquest to the Lamb,<br />
Their triumph to His death.</p>

His zeal inspired their breast;<br />
And, following their incarnate God,<br />
Possess the promised rest.</p>

Forgetting in nothing His blessing to seek.</p>

Each thought and each temper beneath His control;<br />
Thus led by His Spirit to fountains of love,<br />

We haste to Zion's hill,<br />
And there our vows and homage pay.</p>
<p>2 Zion, thrice happy place,<br />
Adorned with wondrous grace,<br />
And walls of strength embrace thee round;<br />
In thee our tribes appear,<br />
To pray and praise and hear<br />
The sacred Gospel's joyful sound.</p>
<p>3 There David's greater Son<br />
Has fixed His royal throne —<br />
He sits for grace and judgement there:<br />
He bids the saint be glad,<br />
He makes the sinner sad,<br />
And humble souls rejoice with fear.</p>
<p>4 May peace attend thy gate,<br />
And joy within thee wait<br />
To bless the soul of every guest:<br />
The man that seeks thy peace,<br />
And wishes thine increase,<br />
A thousand blessings on him rest.</p>
<p>5 My tongue repeats her vows.<br />
Peace to this sacred house!<br />
For there my friends and kindred dwell;<br />
And since my glorious God,<br />
Makes thee His blest abode,<br />
My soul shall ever love thee well.</p>

<p>1 The Church's one foundation<br />
Is Jesus Christ her Lord;<br />
She is His new creation<br />
By water and the word:<br />
From heav'n He came and sought her<br />
To be His holy bride;<br />
With His own blood He bought her,<br />
And for her life He died.</p>
<p>2 Elect from every nation,<br />
Yet one o'er all the earth,<br />
Her charter of salvation<br />
One Lord, one faith, one birth;<br />
One holy name she blesses,<br />
Partakes one holy food,<br />
And to one hope she presses<br />
With every grace endued.</p>
<p>3 Though with a scornful wonder<br />
Men see her sore opprest,<br />
By schisms rent asunder,<br />
By heresies distrest;<br />
Yet saints their watch are keeping,<br />
Their cry goes up, "How long?"<br />
And soon the night of weeping<br />
Shall be the morn of song.</p>
<p>4 Mid toil, and tribulation,<br />
And tumult of her war,<br />
She waits the consummation<br />
Of peace for evermore;<br />
Till with the vision glorious<br />
Her longing eyes are blest,<br />
And the great Church victorious<br />
Shall be the Church at rest.</p>
<p>5 Yet she on earth hath union<br />
With God the Three in One,<br />
And mystic sweet communion<br />
With those whose rest is won:<br />
O happy ones and holy!<br />
Lord, give us grace that we,<br />
Like them the meek and lowly,<br />
On high may dwell with Thee.</p>

What can shake thy sure repose?<br />

Springing from eternal love,<br />
Well supply thy sons and daughters,<br />
And all fear of want remove:<br />
Who can faint, while such a river<br />
Ever flows their thirst t' assuage? —<br />
Grace, which, like the Lord, the giver,<br />
Never fails from age to age.</p>
<p>3 Round each habitation hovering,<br />
See the cloud and fire appear!<br />
For a glory and a covering,<br />
Showing that the Lord is near;<br />
He who gives them daily manna,<br />
He who listens when they cry —<br />
Let Him hear the loud hosanna,<br />
Rising to His throne on high.</p>

I through grace, a member am,<br />
Let the world deride or pity,<br />

Fading is the worlding's pleasure,<br />
All his boasted pomp and show;<br />
Solid joys and lasting treasure<br />
None but Zion's children know.</p>

From age to age the same:<br />
And He must win the battle.</p>

Should threaten to undo us:<br />
We will not fear; for God hath willed<br />

His Kingdom is for ever.</p>

<p>2 I thank Thee, too, that Thou hast made<br />
Joy to abound;<br />
So many gentle thoughts and deeds<br />
Circling us round;<br />
That in the darkest spot of earth<br />
Some love is found.</p>
<p>3 I thank Thee more that all my joy<br />
Is touched with pain;<br />
That shadows fall on brightest hours,<br />
That thorns remain;<br />
So that earth's bliss may be my guide,<br />
And not my chain.</p>
<p>4 For Thou who knowest, Lord, how soon<br />
Our weak heart clings,<br />
Hast given us joys, tender and true,<br />
Yet all with wings,<br />
So that we see, gleaming on high,<br />
Diviner things.</p>
<p>5 I thank Thee, Lord, that Thou hast kept<br />
The best in store;<br />
I have enough, yet not too much,<br />
To long for more;<br />
A yearning for a deeper peace<br />
Not known before.</p>
<p>6 I thank Thee, Lord, that here our souls,<br />
Though amply blest,<br />
Can never find, although they seek,<br />
A perfect rest —<br />
Nor ever shall, until they lean<br />
On Jesus' breast.</p>

With one accord our parting hymn of praise:<br />
We rise to bless Thee ere our worship cease;<br />
And now, departing, wait Thy word of peace.</p>
<p>2 Grant us Thy peace upon our home-ward way;<br />
With Thee began, with Thee shall end the day;<br />
Guard Thou the lips from sin, the hearts from shame,<br />
That in this house have called upon Thy name.</p>

Turn Thou for us its darkness into light;<br />
From harm and danger keep Thy children free,<br />
For dark and light are both alike to Thee.</p>

Our balm in sorrow, and our stay in strife;<br />
Then, when Thy voice shall bid our conflict cease,<br />
